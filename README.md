## Requirements

- [Sass] 3.3+
- [Bourbon] 5.0+
- [Neat] 1.6+

It’s recommended that you use [Autoprefixer], as Refills do not come packaged
with vendor prefixes.

[Sass]: https://github.com/sass/sass
[Bourbon]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon
[Neat]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat
[Autoprefixer]: https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer

## Installation

1. Install Refills’ dependencies: [Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon#installation), [Neat](https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat#installation) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/download) (if you plan to use any components that require JavaScript).

2. Go to the [Refills website](http://refills.bourbon.io), click “Show Code” under the component or pattern that you want and copy-paste it into your project.

3. Customize: Most of the components and patterns have a set of Sass variables that allow you to quickly tweak the look and feel.

## Installation for Ruby on Rails

Alternative to copy-pasting manually, we also have a Refills gem that allows you to add components and patterns via Rake tasks.

1. Add Refills to your Gemfile:

  ```ruby
  gem "refills", group: :development
  ```

2. Then run:

  ```bash
  bundle install
  ```

3. Use the following Rails generators:

  List all available snippets:

  ```bash
  rails generate refills:list
  ```

  Add a snippet:

  ```bash
  rails generate refills:import SNIPPET
  ```

  If you want to generate coffeescript instead of javascript, simply add `--coffee`

  ```bash
  rails generate refills:import SNIPPET --coffee
  ```

  This copies the snippet’s partial to `app/views/refills`, the stylesheet to `app/assets/stylesheets/refills` and the JavaScript to `app/assets/javascripts/refills`

## Miscellaneous

If your css reset file does not add webkit antialias, add the following code to your Scss file:

```css
body {
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
}
```
