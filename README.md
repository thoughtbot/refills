## Installation for Ruby on Rails

Alternative to copy-pasting manually, we also have a Refills gem that allows you to add components and patterns via Rake tasks.

1. Add Refills to your Gemfile:

  ```ruby
  
gem 'refills', :git => "git://github.com/JsusMillan/refills.git", :branch => "refills-haml"

  ```

2. Then run:

  ```bash
  bundle install
  ```

3. Use the following Rails generators:

  List all available snippets:

  ```bash
  rails generate refills:list
  ```

  Add a snippet:

  ```bash
  rails generate refills:import SNIPPET
  ```

  If you want to generate coffeescript instead of javascript, simply add `--coffee`

  ```bash
  rails generate refills:import SNIPPET --coffee
  ```

  This copies the snippet’s partial to `app/views/refills`, the stylesheet to `app/assets/stylesheets/refills` and the JavaScript to `app/assets/javascripts/refills`

## Miscellaneous

If your css reset file does not add webkit antialias, add the following code to your Scss file:

```css
body {
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
}
```
